                <p class="txt">Majority of Hong Kong is Cantonese which makes Cantonese culture the most common culture. But there's not only Cantonese people living in Hong Kong. Shanghainese, British, Indians and Jews are also a big part of Hong Kong's population. This makes Hong Kong's culture very diverse and interesting.
                
               
                The food all over Hong Kong is really good. Colonisation brought a lot of western type of cooking To Hong Kong. This western style is being combined with the chinese cooking. It’s Chinese cuisine together with western cuisine.
                
                
                Hong kong is very special when it comes to languages. Chinese and English is the official languages but the actual languages that are being spoken are chinese english mandarin and cantonese.
                
                
                Hong Kong has a lot of religions. Taoism is very common in Hong Kong and its very special. fung shui is believed by many people in Hong Kong. fung shui means “wind and water” it teaches humans how to achieve harmony by the forces of nature and change. something interesting about taoism is also feng shui which is how buildings are supposed to be positioned that agrees with spiritual forces. When you are in Hong Kong you are going to notice the big holes in the buildings. These holes are called dragon gates and are build because dragons are believed to be bringers of good fortune. blocking the dragon's path could bring misfortune and that's why almost all buildings have these weird scapes and holes.</p>
